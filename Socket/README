This directory contains example codes for socket programming in Python,
which have been used in my Network Programming lectures.

Most codes are re-implementing of examples in the text book 
``Internetworking with TCP/IP Vol 3: Client-Server Programming and Applications, Linux/POSIX Sockets Version,'' by D. Comer and D. Stevens.

Those not included in C&S are:
    asyncore*           -- adapted from python document regarding asyncore
    *any_client*        -- inspired by telnet.py in Python Examples
